# Advanced Vehicle Classification for Enhanced Homeland Security

# Car Image Classifier with Fine-Tuned ResNet18

In line with **HTX's mission to harness cutting-edge technologies for safeguarding Singapore**, this project delivers a **computer vision solution** to accurately classify vehicle types from images. Designed for **Home Team departments** such as the **Singapore Police Force** and the **Immigration and Checkpoints Authority**, it enhances surveillance, traffic management, and security operations.

---

## Key Features

- **High-Precision Classification**: Fine-tuned **ResNet-18** model trained on the **Stanford Cars Dataset** to distinguish 196 car models with high accuracy.  
- **Real-Time API Integration**: FastAPI-based service enabling seamless integration for instantaneous vehicle identification.  
- **Scalable and Secure Deployment**: Docker containerization ensures easy deployment, scalability, and security across operational environments.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repo
```bash
    git clone <insert github link>
```

2. Install conda environment

```bash
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  cd my-project
```

3. Check if Docker Is installed. Run the following command to check if Docker is installed. 

```bash
    docker --version
```
If Docker is installed, it will display the version number (e.g., Docker version 20.10.21, build 20fd1d6).

5. Verify Docker Daemon Is Running

```bash
    docker info
```
If the command fails, they need to start Docker. On macOS or Windows, this typically means opening the Docker Desktop application.

6. Build and run the Docker container

```base
    docker build -t stanford-cars-api .
    docker run -p 8000:8000 stanford-cars-api
```

7. Open your browser and navigate to:

```base
    http://localhost:8000/docs
```
This opens the Swagger UI where you can interact with the API.
Use the /predict/ endpoint to upload an image for classification.
    
## Model and Dataset

The Stanford Cars Dataset is a highly specialized dataset designed for fine-grained image classification tasks. It contains images of 196 car models, making it an ideal benchmark for recognizing subtle differences between visually similar classes.
